Font used is by:

Altered dracula by adding align=center to h1.
Learned later I didn't need to do that. Oh well.

Removed some comments from the alice file that were showing up on the html page.

Had to modify one of alice's image names because both dracula and alice had the same cover.jpg.

Mostly cited W3schools for the majority of my css.
