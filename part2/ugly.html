    <div class = "info">I'm currently a fourth-year student at the University of
    Alberta, specializing in computing science and completing the
    Computer Game Development certificate. I like to draw and program. I
    think it's really important to have both of these things. I like making my own costumes and teching myself new skills. I enjoy playing video games, reading, and watching anime. </div>

  <h1> My history </h1>
    <div class = "info"> I'm originally from Grande Prairie, AB. I studied at Grande
  Prairie Regional College (GPRC) for two years before transferring to the U
  of A in 2014. Originally, I was planning to complete a degree in the arts,
 but I switched to computing science for my second year at GPRC. I have a background in Skills competitions,
 competing in both secondary and post-secondary graphic design. I defeated NAIT and SAIT competitiors
 to reach <a href ="http://www.dailyheraldtribune.com/2014/05/25/local-students-heading-to-national-skills-canada-event">the National competition in Toronto 2014.</a> I did my first Hackathon this year 
and I really enjoyed it! I've also participated in a GameJam in the past as the artist for our 48 hour project.

  <h1>What I have to Offer </h1>
    <div class = "info"> I have skills in both the arts and the sciences. I will be
    completing my degree specializion in computing science this April,
    and I have worked as a graphic designer fullime for two summers. I am a very hard worker, I
 am eager to learn new things, and I'm good at learning things on my own.</div>

  <h1>Important Things to Know About Me </h1>
    <div class = "info"> I'm a pretty quiet person. I really care about mental health, LGBTQ+ issues, and
